The Old Ways: A Breeding Ground for Corruption:
Traditionally, agricultural markets have been riddled with corruption, with middlemen exploiting farmers, offering low prices for their produce, and pocketing significant profits for themselves. Farmers, the backbone of our societies, were left impoverished, struggling to make ends meet despite their hard work. The lack of transparency in transactions and manipulative practices further marginalized these hardworking individuals, perpetuating a cycle of poverty.

The Dawn of Transparency and Fairness:
Enter the new era, marked by a protocol that champions transparency, fairness, and empowerment. By utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts, this protocol ensures that every transaction is recorded immutably on the blockchain, eliminating any room for manipulation. Smart contracts facilitate direct transactions between farmers and buyers, eliminating the need for intermediaries. The protocol empowers farmers to receive fair prices for their produce, leading to increased income and financial stability.

Key Features and Benefits:

Direct Transactions: Farmers can now engage in direct transactions with buyers, ensuring they receive the full value of their produce without any middlemen siphoning off profits.
Transparent Pricing: Blockchain technology ensures transparent and fair pricing, preventing price manipulation and ensuring that farmers are paid a just amount for their hard work.
Financial Inclusion: By offering a secure platform for transactions, even farmers in remote areas can participate, promoting financial inclusion and economic growth in previously underserved regions.
Elimination of Corruption: The protocol's transparency eradicates corruption by creating an immutable ledger of transactions, making it impossible for dishonest practices to go unnoticed.
Stability and Sustainability: With fair prices and direct transactions, farmers can invest in their farms, leading to increased productivity, sustainable agricultural practices, and overall economic stability.
How it Works:

Farmers Register: Farmers register their produce on the platform, providing details about their crops and expected yield.
Buyers Engage: Buyers, ranging from local markets to international traders, can browse the offerings and directly engage with farmers.
Smart Contracts: Upon agreement, smart contracts facilitate the transaction, ensuring secure payment to the farmer upon delivery of the produce.
Immutable Record: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable ledger that proves the fairness of the transaction.
A New Dawn for Farmers:
This protocol represents more than just a technological advancement; it signifies hope, empowerment, and dignity for farmers worldwide. No longer shackled by the corrupt practices of the past, farmers can look forward to a future where their hard work is rewarded justly, enabling them to provide better lives for themselves and their families.

Conclusion:
The protocol's impact reaches far beyond the realms of technology. It embodies a vision of a world where fairness prevails, where every farmer is respected, and where agriculture becomes a beacon of economic strength for communities. Join us in this journey toward a brighter, more equitable future for farmers â€“ the true architects of our sustenance and prosperity. Together, let's sow the seeds of change and reap a harvest of empowerment.


## Getting Started
## Requirements
### git
   ## You'll know you did it right if you can run 
     git --version 
 and you see a response like git version x.x.x
### foundry
 ## You'll know you did it right if you can run 
    forge --version 
 and you see a response like forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)

### Quickstart
    git clone https://github.com/bennymunyiri/foundry-defi-stablecoin
    cd foundry-defi-stablecoin-f23 
    forge build
## Usage
### Start a local node
    make anvil
## Deploy
This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

    make deploy

## Deployment to a testnet or mainnet
Setup environment variables
You'll want to set your SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY as environment variables. You can add them to a .env file, similar to what you see in .env.example.

PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of your account (like from metamask). NOTE: FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
You can learn how to export it here.
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from Alchemy
Optionally, add your ETHERSCAN_API_KEY if you want to verify your contract on Etherscan.

## Get testnet ETH
Head over to faucets.chain.link and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

## Deploy
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
